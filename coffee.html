                  <h2>Coffee Boom </h2>

                  <p>Coffee was introduced to Brazil in 1727 and has been a crucial part of the Brazilian economy ever since. São Paulo was one of the first cities to benefit from the coffee boom, becoming a center for coffee commerce in the 19th century. As we saw before, Sao Paulo was in a good geographic location that made it a gateway between the port of Santos and the rest of the crescent Brazilian territory. With the crescent plantations of coffee in São Paulo,was built in the second half of XIX century the Santos-Jundiai railway that facilitated the path of the coffee beans of the whole  São Paulo area to the Port of Santos.<br><br>


                 Although slavering still used at the time, bringing slaves from Africa was becoming too hard due the England sanctions. The coffee boom attracted São Paulo’s first major wave of foreign immigrants after 1860, mostly poor Europeans (particularly Italian, German, and Greek individuals) seeking work, although they were soon followed by a number of Japanese, Arabian, Chinese, and Korean immigrants. When slavery was outlawed in 1888, the need for workers only grew. São Paulo’s considerable Jewish community also was established around this time. By the time the coffee boom fizzled in the early 1900s, the city had already branched out into other industries.<br><br>

                Between the coffee boom and wealth coming from mines in the interior of the country, São Paulo soon became the richest city and province in the nation. Railroads were built, connecting it to the other important cities. By the turn of the century, important industries were making their base in São Paulo, and the immigrants kept pouring in. By then, São Paulo was attracting immigrants not only from Europe and Asia but from within Brazil as well: Poor, uneducated workers from the Brazilian northeast flooded into São Paulo looking for work.</p>
