            <h2>About us </h2>

            <p> Discover SP, is a webguide of the city São Paulo, Brazil, made by the Griffith College students Arthur Arthur Carbonari Martins (ID 3028568) and Vinicius Pepe Bellomo (ID 3052662)  for the subject Client Side Web Development. Our goal is to show a little bit of the best things to do in the biggest city of South America, focusing specifically in its central region, as São Paulo  has 80km of urban extension and everything from everywhere was necessary to select a really small number of close localities. We hope we were able to inform, even if just a little, about this huge and lovely city.</p>
