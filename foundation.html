            <h2>The Foundation of São Paulo</h2>

            <p>
              The first European settler in the area was João Ramalho, a Portuguese sailor who had been shipwrecked. He was the first to explore the area of present-day São Paulo. Like many cities in Brazil, São Paulo was founded by Jesuit Missionaries. São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga was established in 1554 as a mission to convert Guainás natives to Catholicism. In 1556–1557 the Jesuits built the first school in the region. The town was strategically located, being between the ocean and fertile lands to the west, and it is also on the Tietê River. It became an official city in 1711.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the early years of São Paulo, it became the home base for the Bandeirantes, which were explorers, enslavers, and prospectors who explored the interior of Brazil. In this remote corner of the Portuguese Empire, there was no law, so ruthless men would explore the uncharted swamps, mountains, and rivers of Brazil taking whatever they wanted, be it native people to enslave, precious metals, or stones. Some of the more ruthless Bandeirantes, such as Antonio Rapôso Tavares (1598-1658), would even sack and burn Jesuit missions and enslave the natives who lived there. The Bandeirantes explored a great deal of the Brazilian interior, but at a high cost: Thousands, if not millions of natives, were killed and enslaved in their raids.​​

            <p>
              With the discovery of  gold, and subsequent  precious stones, in the state of Minas Gerais at the end of the seventeenth century,  São Paulo felt the gold boom, because its geographic location was a gateway to Minas Gerais and the Port of Santos, where all goods were shipped from the new continent to the old continent. Some of the profits were invested in sugarcane plantations, which were quite profitable for a time.
