                  <h2>Pitico </h2>

                  <p>If there were a ranking for São Paulo’s most unpretentious bar, Pitico would certainly be among the top three. Essentially made up of several large containers in an open space that once housed a parking lot, customers are invited to lounge on folding chairs typically reserved for the beach and share community tables. Catering to the 20-something generation, the bar cuts on costs by not having waitstaff, meaning customers must go up to one of the container structures to order food and drinks. Despite a limited menu and no-frills approach, Pitico has neverthless become a hit with São Paulo residents and visitors alike due to its convivial atmosphere and fun-loving crowds. There is also a grocery store with products from local family-owned farms and a stage for events. Pitico does not serve Coca-Cola, but does have organic guarana for those who prefer non-alcoholic drinks. </p>

                  <h2>Astor</h2>

                  <p>If some places in the city are known for their cold beer, Astor is known for its cocktails. With a menu that features a parade of colourful drinks and a vintage-leaning décor of white tiles and antique mirrors, Astor is a bohemian throwback for customers nostalgic for the 1950s and 1960s. It is frequented by a more mature audience who enjoys nightlife and can spend a little more. Friends meeting for an after-work drink sit side by side with regular customers who have bottles of whiskey with their name on it, waiting to be consumed at the bar. Astor’s cuisine is another factor that attracts customers, with tasty snacks, steaks and sandwiches. The filet mignon strip with onions is considered to be one of the best in town.</p>

                  <h2>Bar do Juarez</h2>

                  <p>The scent of barbecue emanating from the tables at Bar do Juarez leaves little doubt as to what keeps customers coming back for more: picanha. Meat arrives almost raw to the table and is cooked in front of the customers, and is accompanied by farofa, vinaigrette sauce and Italian bread. The original idea was to recreate the bohemian atmosphere of the last century, but the bar now caters to those wanting to enjoy happy hour and those who come to watch wednesday night football with friends.

                  <h2>Vaca Veia</h2>

                  <p>If making friends is your objective then Itaim Bibi’s Vaca Veia is the place to go. The upscale bar usually fills up by happy hour with young executives and by 10pm crowds are already spilling out into the streets. The atmosphere is relaxed and many of those who are unable to find a place to sit inside usually resort to drinking standing up, near the life-sized and colourful fibreglass cow purchased by owners from the first São Paulo Cow Parade (where cows painted by local artists were placed in strategic locations around the city). To accompany the drinks the house has a menu filled with light fare from quiches to sandwiches and salads.
