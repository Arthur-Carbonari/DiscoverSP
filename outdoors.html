                  <h2>Ibirapuera Park</h2>

                  <p>
                    Elected as one of the best urban parks on the planet by the UK daily newspaper The Guardian, Ibirapuera Park is an island of green and tranquility in the middle of this very noisy city.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to the thirteen playgrounds, lakes, picnic spaces and bike lanes, the park contains within its boundaries the OCA museum, the Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Afro-Brazilian Museum.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is also here that every two years the art scene comes alive with the São Paulo biennale.

                  <h2>Villa Lobos Park</h2>

                  <p>
                    Named after one of Brazil’s most famous classical composers, the park is one of the most beloved in the entire city, with almost 20,000 visitors passing through on any given weekend.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The park, located in the Alto de Pinheiros neighbourhood, encompasses 732,000 square metres of green space which also houses a bicycle path, football fields, playground, gym equipment, jogging track, and a forest with species from the native Mata Atlantica (Atlantic Forest).

                  <h2>Liberdade</h2>

                  <p>
                    No trip to São Paulo would be complete without a visit to the Liberdade neighbourhood, Japan’s largest colony outside of Japan. Walk around Liberdade and you will feel a part of Japan in the largest city in South America.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is estimated that about 400,000 Japanese and descendants live in São Paulo today, many in the streets of Liberdade. With Japanese lanterns decorating the streets and dozens of sushi establishments and specialised food stores where one can find Japanese, Thai and Korean products for sale, Liberdade is a true centre for its tight-knit community.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It even has its own Japanese-language newspaper and hosts several annual Eastern culture festivals including Chinese New Year.

                  <h2>Paulista Avenue</h2>

                  <p>
                    Avenida Paulista is São Paulo's center of activity, full of things to do and a favorite destination for both tourists and locals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is an ideal spot for people-watching from one of the numerous sidewalk cafes. The area is home to many shops, theaters, galleries, and museums, including the São Paulo Museum of Art (MASP).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are also several adjacent parks, like Parque Trianon, which provides a foliage-dense oasis right in the city center.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This main avenue hosts numerous festivals and celebrations throughout the year, and every Sunday is closed to traffic to become a dedicated space for walks, meetings, play music and several other things.
                  </p>
